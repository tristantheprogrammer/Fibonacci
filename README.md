Welcome to my Fibonacci Number program!

To use this program, type "java -jar --enable-preview Fibonacci.jar x" to see what Fibonacci Number is in that spot.

The "x" in the command is just whatever number you want to use. Make sure to enter a positive integer value.

Have fun finding Fibonacci Numbers!
